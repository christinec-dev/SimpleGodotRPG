# SimpleRPG
This game was made from a [tutorial](https://www.davidepesce.com/godot-tutorials/) series covering the basics of developing a simple 2D top-down RPG with Godot and gdscript. This helped me get started with Godot game development by learning to use sprites, physics, animations, GUIs, sounds and to program the logic of the game with the Godot script language, GDScript.

### Game features:
1. Player movement
2. Physics and collisions
3. Using tile maps to create the game map
4. 2D Sprite animation
5. Designing the game GUI
6. Monsters and Artificial Intelligence
7. Attacks, Damage & Death
8 Picking and Using Items
9. Experience Points and Level Advancement
10. NPCs, Quests and Dialogues
11. Start Menu – Changing Scene – Saving and Loading the game
